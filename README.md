# Reference-Solution-for-PDEs
This repository aims at making a reference solution to PDE of interest using Spectral Methods(and others) with custom resolution.

So far, 1-dimensional Burgers' Equation, KdV Equation, and Allen Cahn Equation are implemented.(Time-dependent 1 dimensional PDEs)

One can get the PDE solution that looks like a matrix in ".mat" file. 

The codes are treating 2-dim(spatial and temporal axes) solutions.

I followed the methodology used by https://nbviewer.org/url/ignite.byu.edu/che541/lectures/spectral.ipynb .

Thanks!
